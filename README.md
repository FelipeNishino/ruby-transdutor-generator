# ruby-transdutor-generator
 
This is just a for-fun project that I started developing as I was studying Formal Languages and Automatons.
Just input all the needed data for a DFN (Deterministic Finite Automaton) and a ruby script named "GeneratedTransdutor.rb" will be created with a transdutor for that automata.
Also will probably make some proper methods later alongside a consctructor-like approach for declaration.
